<h1>All about the new CEO and Chairman of the New England Patriots</h1>
<h2>and the details about this season and the weeks leading to the Superbowl</h2>

<p>For those who do not already know him, Andrew Robbins is a nineteen year old, first year student at
the Univeristy of Maine. He is currently completing his business major, with a concentration in marketing. In his free time he works as the CEO and chairman of the New England Patriots. He has been very busy in his last few weeks at work. Beating the chargers at the Pat's home field, Gillette Stadium, was just a warm up for the team. The next week was an even greater win when the team was able to have a classic Brady and Belichick late game comeback in Kansas City.</p>
