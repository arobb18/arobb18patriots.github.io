Along with the ending of the AFC and NFC championships, there was much ridicule put on the officiating of the game. There is controversy surrounding where the referees for the game where from, and that four of the seven officials used for the NFC game were born around the Los Angeles area. This could mean a number of things. Is the NFL bending some of the most sacred rules of all time? Are these games being "set up" or "rigged"? What does this mean for Roger Goodell? What is his next move to setting the claims against the integrity of the NFL?
