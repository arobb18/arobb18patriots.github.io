Now for the all of the people out there that do not believe in Tom Brady, I'm here today to tell you why you should. Let's look at some of the numbers. Tom Brady is going into his 9th super bowl, five of which he won. This means by the numbers, Tom Brady has a better chance of winning the game than Jared Goff has to complete a pass! I'm going to bet on Brady!
