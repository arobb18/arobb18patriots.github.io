In the weeks to come the patriots need to do a lot of preparation for the Los Angeles spread. The Rams have one of the best secondaries in the league this season, and Brady's sharpness and quick decision making will be tested in the air. The Patriots defense also needs to prepare for the game. Not only is the youngest head coach in the league to ever make it to the super bowl leading a hot shot rookie quarterback Jared Goff, but he has plenty of options on the ground. Running backs like Todd Gurley are going to be a back pain for New England's 11 defensive starters.
